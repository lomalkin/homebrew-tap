# Homebrew formula of blessh, published to the tap lomalkin/homebrew-tap by
# the release job; render.sh fills in the version, URL and checksum of the
# macOS tarball. One program is the client and the server; the server is
# a Homebrew service that `blessh server enable` starts
# (docs/macos-server.md).

    <<~EOS
      Connect to a server nearby (macOS asks once whether blessh may use
      Bluetooth):
        blessh scan
        blessh user@server

      Serve this Mac over Bluetooth (asks for sudo once, to set up sshd on
      127.0.0.1; Remote Login does not have to be on):
        blessh server enable
      It runs as the Homebrew service blessh; stop it and remove the sshd
      setup with:
        blessh server disable
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "blessh #{version}", shell_output("#{bin}/blessh --version")
    assert_match "blessh server", shell_output("#{bin}/blessh server --help")
